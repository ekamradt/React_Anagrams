# React Anagrams

My first react app for a browser. It was time to get to know react.


### Storage
To store entered anagrams so they can be listed, ```sessionStorage```
was used so that all data disappears with the browser tab.


### The Code
The code is somewhat of a mismatch of different react coding 
techniques as I learn different approaches people take.
